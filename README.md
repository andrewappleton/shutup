# shutup
## Mute Mac and turn off display
Make `shutup` executable: `chmod +x shutup`
Place `shutup` file in system path, i.e. /usr/local/bin

Use case: ðŸ˜†
When I'm sleeping on the sofa and my Mac is noisy with WhatsApp, Messenger, email, etc. noises...  I can connect via my iPad with: `ssh me@mymac /usr/local/bin/shutup`
Works better if you have ssh set up properly to allow passwordless execution.
